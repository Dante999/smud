SMUD (Simple Multi User Dungeon)

this is a little hobby-project to create my own textbased adventure. The idea 
is, to build a engine, which can simply be fed with .xml-files which hold
informations about rooms, items, creatures. 

the project is created with qtCreator, but only uses plain c++. Just open the
.pro file in the src/ folder with qtCreator and start coding. 

Of course this is nothing against greater projects like ''ldmud'' which use
the LPC-Language to create a mud. 

In the current stage, smud only runs locally, like a singleplayer-game. 

src/			holds the source files
gamedata/		holds the gamedata (rooms, items e.g.)
documentation/		diagrams e.g.
